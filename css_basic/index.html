			<h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
			
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello! I'm excited to share my journey in web development with you. This is my very first HTML page, and I'm learning how to create beautiful and functional websites. Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my growing skills and passion for coding.</p>
			
			<p>Web development has always fascinated me because it combines creativity with technical problem-solving. Every line of code I write brings me closer to understanding how the internet works and how I can contribute to making it a better place for everyone.</p>
			
			<h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
			<p>I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my web development education. Each day brings new challenges and discoveries, from understanding semantic HTML tags to creating responsive layouts that work on all devices.</p>
			
			<p>The most rewarding part of this journey has been seeing my code come to life in the browser. What starts as simple text transforms into interactive, visually appealing web pages that users can engage with and enjoy.</p>
			
			<h3>Future Goals</h3>
			<p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer who can build complete web applications from start to finish. I'm excited to learn more advanced technologies and frameworks that will help me create even more dynamic and powerful websites.</p>
